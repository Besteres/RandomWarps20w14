# RandomWarps20w14
A small python program with the intention of using the command prompt of a minecraft server (version 20w14infinite) to execute a command to teleport all players on that server to a random dimension every x seconds (incluing easter egg ones!)

This was a small program that i made after remembering about 20w14infinite snapshot and discovering the /warp command that allows you or every player to travel to the dimension you type in, since theres no way that i know to create plugins or datapacks on this snapshot i decided to use the server application to run that command for every player in that hosted server.
Had some fun testing it with a friend and decided to release it

Feel free to use my work or code as long as you credit me in some way
Have fun!
